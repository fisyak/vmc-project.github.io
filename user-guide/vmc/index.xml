      <description>The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) allows to run different simulation Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input and output format as well as the geometry and detector response definition.
The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc. It provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo, two of which have the key role:</description>

      <description>The core of the VMC, VMC library, provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo:
 TVirtualMC: Interface to the concrete Monte Carlo program TVirtualMCApplication: Interface to the user&amp;rsquo;s Monte Carlo application TVirtualMCStack: Interface to the particle stack TVirtualMCDecayer: Interface to the external decayer TVirtualMCSensitiveDetector: Interface to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive detector  The implementation of the TVirtualMC interface is provided for two Monte Carlo transport codes, GEANT3 and Geant4, with the VMC packages listed below.</description>

      <description>Introduction The VMC package allows splitting the event simulation among multiple engines. The criteria of how to split the simulation have to be defined by the user and among others the decision which engine to be used could depend on
 geometry particle phase space particle type any combination of that &amp;hellip;  Running multiple engines is fully supported for
 GEANT3_VMC GEANT4_VMC  This also allows the user to implement his/her own class deriving from TVirtualMC to be used in a split simulation.</description>
